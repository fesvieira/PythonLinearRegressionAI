# Solar Power Predict AI
A linear regression AI used to predict solar power generation with given data

- Currently, there are various photovoltaic energy systems being installed in Brazil. This new market has experienced exponential growth in recent years, and as a result, the technology behind it is continually advancing.

- Growatt is a company that manufactures frequency inverters for solar energy. They offer a variety of inverter types for sale, allowing for a wide range of installations. Combining this with the rapid growth of the market, there is still much room for development and maturation in this field. There are few high-quality training courses available for individuals interested in this area, and universities have yet to significantly incorporate this lucrative field into their electrical engineering programs.

- The aim of this project is to develop a technology related to this market, incorporating intelligent systems, as per the scope of the discipline. With this in mind, the team has decided to create a neural network capable of predicting the generation data of an inverter, specifically from Growatt, which is the most familiar to the group.
